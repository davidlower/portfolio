      <div class="biography-text-container">
        <p class="biography-text">I am currently in the throes of changing careers. I have been in Medicine for 14 years (as an Osteopath). I recently enjoyed a very successful stint in Canada. I had patients from all walks of life coming to see me and an excellent referral system
          the community. I was becoming very well know and in demand. I was beginning to feel like I had finally reached the top of my game.<br><br> I then moved back to Europe in 2016 and having children, I took a year off (maternity leave). In that
          year I reflected on what I wanted in life and I came to a very clear but shocking conclusion...<br><br> In 2014 I made my first ever website on Wordpress, completely self-taught. At the time it took about 8-12 hours per day and I finished it
          in a month. I have never felt such satisfaction. From knowing nothing to having built a working website that actually brought patients to my door was unreal. My best friend at the time was a programmer and a web developer. We spent many hours
          talking about design, website, tech trends, latest gadgets and creating.<br><br> Due to unforeseen circumstance, I had to quickly leave England, at which point I moved to Canada. Before I left I knew I had to build a second website, this time
          with the focus on SEO. I needed my website to be at the top of google for my profession, amidst stiff local competition. The learning curve was, again, another steep one.<br><br> Once released, it took only 4 months to reach number 1 in google
          for my city (screenshot here). Soon after that, I reached number 2 in my neighboring city as well. <a href="Img/2nd-webiste-No1-in-google-compressor.jpg">See screenshots here</a>.<br><br> During this process of learning and creating, something
          permanently changed inside of me. I truly found something I loved doing. I literally would be excited to get home and start building on my website.<br><br> Whenever I had a spare minute I would be reading or watching tutorials on anything and
          everything related to the web and design. It became a quiet passion. Although my main profession was still my drive, things never came naturally. I often had to force myself to continue my blog. It was not natural for me to pick up my anatomy
          textbooks. There was always a resistance to doing it. Yet when it came to design and websites I found my heart longing for it and constantly willing. When this goes on for a few years you begin to ask questions.<br><br> This brought me to my
          conclusion. I loved treating people and helping them as an Osteopath and I still do today. I never felt like I had a bad day at the office. But I never long for it either. I never got excited about it. With coding, design and web developer I
          do.
          <br><br> It was upon this stark, real conclusion that I decided to pursue my dreams. I know I will reach this goal... It is just a matter of when.<br><br> I want to become a front-end-developer and then explore full-stack. I just finished building
          my third website with Wordpress. It is still currently live and can be viewed <a href="http://davidandsigi.com">here</a>.
